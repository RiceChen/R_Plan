R_Plan

[英文页](README.md) |

There is a wide range of embedded development tools for developers, and whenever we start developing, we need to open every tool one by one. For example, serial port, network debugging assistant, etc. Sometimes when multiple tools are opened, we still will waste time switching from different tools. 

To solve this problem, I started writing an Integrated Software Toolkit on Host Computer to integrate all the host computer software I used, so the R-Plan is built, which is the abbreviation for Rice Plan. Each function is like a grain of rice, gradually stacked into a bowl of rice.
